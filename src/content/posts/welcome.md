Hey! Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I’m Kethaka—a 23-year-old computer science major who’s way too obsessed with building random apps, poking around in tech, and figuring out how things break (and how to fix them). If it’s creative, nerdy, or just plain weird, I’m probably into it.

Here, you’ll find all sorts of stuff: cool things I stumble across, guides and tutorials I wish existed when I started out, and deep dives into projects I’m working on. I also love breaking down wild cyber attacks and hacks—think of it as story time, but with more code and less sleep.

Basically, if it’s something that made me go “whoa, that’s awesome” or “ugh, why did nobody write this up before?”, it’ll probably end up here. Sometimes it’s tech, sometimes it’s design, music, movies, or just whatever I’m geeking out about that week.

Thanks for dropping by! Hope you find something here that helps, inspires, or at least entertains you. Let’s keep building cool stuff and learning new things together.
