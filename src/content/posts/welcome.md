Welcome. I’m Kethaka—a builder, problem-solver, and relentless tinkerer.

This site isn’t just a blog. It’s a workshop, a lab, and sometimes a postmortem. Every project, guide, or breakdown you’ll find here started as a personal itch—something I needed, something that bugged me, or something I just had to understand. I build to turn chaos into clarity, and I share what I learn so others can skip the guesswork (or at least enjoy the mess).

Here’s what you’ll find:
- **Deep dives** into how things work (and sometimes, why they break)
- **Guides and tutorials** I wish existed when I started
- **Stories from the trenches**—the wins, the bugs, the “aha!” moments
- The occasional tangent into design, music, or whatever else I’m obsessing over that week

I care about craft. I care about making things that feel right, not just work. If you’re here, you probably do too.

So poke around. Steal an idea. Fix a bug. Or just enjoy the ride. If you leave with a new insight—or a new itch to scratch—then this place is doing its job.
