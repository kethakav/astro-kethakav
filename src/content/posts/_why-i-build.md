title: "Why I Build"

I’ve been building things for as long as I can remember.

Before I wrote my first line of code, I was already breaking toys apart, sticking my fingers into power outlets (not recommended), and asking dangerous questions like “what happens if I connect this to that?” That urge to *understand* how things work—rather than just use them—has always driven me. Over time, my curiosity only grew sharper and more intentional.

Now, I build because it gives me a sense of control over chaos. There’s a unique satisfaction in turning nothing into something. And, if I’m honest, it feels damn good to show people something that works well, looks clean, and solves a real problem.

My projects rarely start with “what would look good in an interview?” More often, they begin with “I wish this existed” or “this is annoying me enough to fix.” I solve real problems—usually my own—then refine those solutions until they’re good enough to help others too.

## 🎯 Depth Before Demos

Before I write a single line of code, I dive into the docs. I want to *understand* the tools I’m using—their constraints, the philosophy behind the framework, and the hidden costs. It’s not about being a purist. I use AI tools—Gemini, Cursor, Copilot—but I don’t let them write the story for me. I guide them, prompting like a lead engineer, not a passive observer. Using AI effectively still requires taste, structure, and decision-making.

## 💡 Speed *and* Craft

People talk about the trade-off between speed and quality like you have to pick one. I don’t buy it.

You can build fast *if you know what you’re doing*. You can build well *if you care about how things feel*. You can do both *if you start with the right foundation*—understand the stack, make smart decisions early, and don’t compromise blindly.

Sometimes I cut corners, but never by accident. I choose where to sacrifice—and I always know why.

## 🎨 Aesthetics Matter

There’s something special about using a product that *feels* right. That moment when the UI just clicks, the colors soothe your eyes, and the animations don’t just work—they guide you.

That’s what I aim for in everything I build.

A good product shouldn’t just *solve* a problem. It should solve it beautifully. I want people to feel like they’re unboxing an iPhone 5 again—that sensation of care, polish, and intention.

## 🧩 Why I’ll Keep Building

Because the feeling of *something finally working* after the hundredth attempt is addictive. Because I love looking at a blank screen and thinking, “What can I make today?” Because the internet is full of bad software—and I want to make better ones.

I don’t want to be just another dev on the internet. I want my work to speak for itself. I want it to feel thoughtful. Useful. Sharp. I want people to use something I built and say, “This guy gets it.”

And that’s why I build.
