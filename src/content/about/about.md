Hi, I'm Kethaka. This will be my personal website where I share about my projects, guides or tutorials that would have saved me hundreds of hours, or just random thoughts that pop onto my head.

It's a work in progress. See y'all soon. 

In the meantime, come say hi [@kethakav](https://x.com/kethakav), or kethaka.22@cse.mrt.ac.lk

<!-- Hi, I’m Kethaka. I’m a builder, problem-solver, and aesthetic perfectionist. I make tools, interfaces, and experiences that feel like they were crafted, not just coded.

I don’t just build things because I can — I build them because I need them. Every project here solved a personal itch, then evolved into something polished enough to ship to the world.

I specialize in turning chaos into clarity. With code, with design, and occasionally — with dumbbells. -->
